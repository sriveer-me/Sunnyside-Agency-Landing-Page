## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Writing this simple project taught to me the importance of css archietecture and reusable styling, not to mention the power and usefulness of media queries..
furthermore I came to the conclusion that what can be done by css must be done bu css and js must be used in styling as little as possible.
